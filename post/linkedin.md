**Header:** How I built a "Vibe Check" app for Squad Photos using Gemini 2.5 📸✨

Ever tried to get a decent group photo where everyone looks good AND the background is cool? It’s impossible.

So I built **SquadMix**.

It’s a React app that takes individual selfies of your friends and uses Google's new **Gemini 2.5 Flash** model to composite them into any scenario you can imagine.

**How it works:**
1. Upload 1-5 individual pics.
2. Pick a Vibe (Cyberpunk, 90s Retro, Music Festival, Startup Founders...).
3. AI generates a unified group shot in seconds.

**The Tech Stack:**
⚡ React 19 for the UI
🎨 Tailwind CSS for that dark-mode/neon aesthetic
🧠 Google GenAI SDK (@google/genai) for the magic

The coolest part? I'm using the **Gemini 2.5 Flash Image** model, which is incredibly fast and understands complex multimodal prompts (images + text) better than anything I've used before.
